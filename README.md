# Monitor-Code
This is directly connected to web-app-code. It receives and parses data coming from multiple instances of the web app and displays it on its own webpage. This is also contained within docker. The great thing about this project was the fact that loads of instances of web apps could be spun up in docker and then the monitor would pick up the transmissions from them and display it.
